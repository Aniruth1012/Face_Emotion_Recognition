# Face_Emotion_Recognition
I'm pleased to share that I've developed an advanced emotion face detection system with good accuracy. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow and Keras libraries, the model accurately classifies emotions into two distinct categories, ensuring precise results. To enhance the user experience, I meticulously integrated this cutting-edge technology into a user-friendly HTML front end. The integration was seamlessly achieved using Flask, a lightweight and efficient web framework. To add a touch of sophistication and visual appeal, I incorporated subtle CSS animations, creating an immersive and aesthetically pleasing interface for users. This comprehensive approach not only guarantees accurate emotion detection but also provides an engaging and visually appealing experience for users interacting with the system.
